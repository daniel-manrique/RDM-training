## We face a reproducibility/ethical crisis {style="text-align: center;"}

![Reports on the reproducibility crisis](images/crisis1.png){fig-align=center}

## Some well-known causes

## Research Data Management (RDM)

RDM consist in the organization/handling, storage, sharing and (short-long term) preservation of research data. This can include physical objects/files, documents, images, audio, etc.

## Why RDM is important? 

### From a researchers perspective

- Managing data correctly makes your data usable/reusable (for you and others).
- Ensure the fidelity and and encourages validation of your research.
- Improve your efficiency and that of your research team.
- Upholds the professional/ethical commitment to research integrity.


## Why RDM is important?

### From a social/legal perspective

- Funding agencies require data management plans (DMPs) and open sharing of data to maximaze benefits to society. [Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy-frequently-asked-questions)
- Hopefully, in a few years the deposit of raw data and analysis codes will be a requirement of scientific journals. 
- Help to build trust in the scientific endeavor through transparent open science practices.


## In summary...

RDM is a matter of professional responsibility, ethical behavior, and commitment to best scientific practices.

::: {.r-fit-text}
- **Findable:** All data must carry identifiers and metadata that facilitate its discovery. 
- **Accessible:** The community should be able to access your data. 
- **Interoperable:** The data must comply with specific standards (i.e. standardized vocabularies) and formats (i.e. .csv, .tif).  
- **Reusable:** The data must be sufficiently described (and licensed) to allow its reuse by the community.
